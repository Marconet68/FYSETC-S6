# Firmware Update
## SD card
Not working for me with RepRapDiscount full graphic Smart controller
The doc says:
 If you choose to upload the firmware with a sdcard. First you need to connect a sdcard module to the S6 EXP2 port. Basically , you can use any kind of LCD screen that contain sdcard module. But if you can't make it work , check if your sdcard module's SPI CS pin connected to PA4 pin in S6 board .

Note: RepRapDiscount full graphic Smart controller
The connection is a bit tricky, youhave to invert connector
